## Ingredients

#### Pasta

- 400g spaghetti
- 2 tablespoons salt (for pasta water)

#### Sauce

- 200g guanciale or pancetta, cut into small strips
- 4 large egg yolks
- 2 whole eggs
- 100g Pecorino Romano, finely grated
- 50g Parmigiano-Reggiano, finely grated
- Freshly cracked black pepper

## Directions

1. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil and add the salt
1. While the water heats, cut the guanciale into small strips or cubes
1. Cook the guanciale in a cold pan over medium heat, rendering the fat until the meat is crispy — about 8 minutes
   1. Do not add oil — the guanciale renders its own fat
1. In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, whole eggs, and most of the grated cheese, reserving some for garnish
   1. Add a generous amount of black pepper to the egg mixture
1. Cook the spaghetti until al dente, about 1 minute less than the packet instructions
1. Reserve a cup of pasta water, then drain the spaghetti
1. Remove the guanciale pan from heat and add the hot pasta, tossing to coat in the rendered fat
1. Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing vigorously
   1. Add a splash of pasta water to create a creamy, silky sauce
   1. The residual heat will gently cook the eggs without scrambling them
1. Serve immediately, topped with the reserved cheese and more black pepper
