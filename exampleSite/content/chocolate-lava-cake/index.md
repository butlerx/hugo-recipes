## Ingredients

#### Cake

- 200g dark chocolate (70% cocoa), broken into pieces
- 100g unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing
- 3 large eggs
- 3 large egg yolks
- 75g caster sugar
- 2 tablespoons plain flour
- Pinch of flaky sea salt
- Cocoa powder, for dusting the ramekins

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 220°C and place a baking tray in the middle rack
1. Generously butter 4 ramekins and dust with cocoa powder, tapping out the excess
   1. This ensures a clean release
1. Melt the chocolate and butter together in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water
   1. Stir until smooth and glossy, then remove from heat and let it cool slightly
1. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, egg yolks, and sugar until thick, pale, and roughly doubled in volume
   1. This should take about 4 minutes with an electric whisk
1. Gently fold the melted chocolate into the egg mixture
   1. Work carefully to keep as much air in the batter as possible
1. Sift in the flour and fold until just combined
   1. Add the pinch of sea salt
1. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared ramekins
   1. The batter can be refrigerated at this point for up to 24 hours — add 2 minutes to the bake time if cold
1. Place the ramekins on the hot baking tray and bake for exactly 12 minutes
   1. The tops should be set and slightly cracked, but the centres should still jiggle
1. Let them rest for 30 seconds, then run a knife around the edge of each ramekin
1. Invert onto serving plates and lift off the ramekins
1. Serve immediately — the molten centre waits for no one
