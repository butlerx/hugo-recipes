## Ingredients

#### Custard Base

- 500ml double cream
- 250ml whole milk
- 150g caster sugar
- 6 large egg yolks
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped

## Directions

1. Heat the milk, half the sugar, and vanilla pod seeds in a saucepan over medium heat until it just begins to simmer
   1. Do not let it boil
1. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the remaining sugar until pale and thick
1. Slowly pour the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to temper the eggs
1. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon
   1. Cook until the custard thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon — about 5 minutes
   1. It should reach around 77°C on a thermometer
1. Remove from heat and stir in the double cream and vanilla extract
1. Strain the custard through a fine sieve into a clean bowl
1. Cover with cling film pressed directly onto the surface to prevent a skin forming
1. Chill in the refrigerator until completely cold — at least 4 hours or overnight
1. Churn the mixture in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions
1. Transfer to a freezer-safe container and freeze for at least 2 hours before serving

> For an extra-smooth texture, blend the chilled custard briefly before churning.
