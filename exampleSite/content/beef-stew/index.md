## Ingredients

#### Stew

- 1kg stewing beef (chuck or shin), cut into 3cm cubes
- 3 tablespoons plain flour
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 onions, roughly chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 carrots, peeled and cut into chunks
- 4 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered
- 2 sticks celery, sliced
- 400ml beef stock
- 330ml stout or dark ale
- 2 tablespoons tomato purée
- 2 bay leaves
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Pat the beef dry with kitchen paper and season generously with salt and pepper
1. Toss the beef in the flour, shaking off any excess
1. Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed casserole over high heat
1. Brown the beef in batches, getting a good sear on all sides — about 3 minutes per batch
   1. Do not crowd the pan or the meat will steam instead of browning
   1. Transfer each batch to a plate
1. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions to the same pot
   1. Cook for 5 minutes until softened, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom
1. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute
1. Stir in the tomato purée and cook for 2 minutes
1. Pour in the stout, stirring to deglaze the pot
1. Return the beef to the pot and add the stock, bay leaves, and thyme
1. Bring to a gentle simmer, then cover and cook on low heat for 1.5 hours
1. Add the carrots, potatoes, and celery
1. Continue cooking covered for another 1.5 hours until the beef is fork-tender and the vegetables are soft
1. Remove the bay leaves and thyme sprigs
1. Taste and adjust the seasoning
1. Serve in warm bowls with crusty bread for mopping up the gravy
