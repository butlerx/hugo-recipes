## Ingredients

#### Dough

- 500g strong white bread flour
- 350g water (lukewarm)
- 100g active sourdough starter
- 10g fine sea salt

## Directions

1. Mix the flour and water in a large bowl until no dry flour remains
   1. Let it rest for 30 minutes (autolyse)
1. Add the sourdough starter and salt to the dough
   1. Use the pinch-and-fold method to incorporate — pinch the dough, then fold it over itself
   1. Continue for about 5 minutes until well combined
1. Perform a series of stretch and folds over the next 2 hours
   1. Every 30 minutes, pull one side of the dough up and fold it over to the centre
   1. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat — 4 folds per session
1. Cover the bowl and let the dough bulk ferment at room temperature for 4–6 hours
   1. The dough should roughly double in size and feel airy
1. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a round boule
   1. Use a bench scraper to build tension on the surface
1. Place the shaped dough seam-side up in a well-floured banneton
1. Cover and refrigerate overnight (12–16 hours) for a cold retard
1. Preheat your oven to 250°C with a Dutch oven inside for at least 45 minutes
1. Score the top of the loaf with a razor blade or sharp knife
1. Bake covered for 20 minutes, then remove the lid and bake for a further 25 minutes until deep golden brown
1. Cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing
